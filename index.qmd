## Overview

*Ethical Algorithms for the Modern Clinician* is a short course intended to teach future clinicians the basics of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) as they pertain to clinical practice.

This resource does ***not*** discuss how machine learning algorithms work or how to build ML models. Instead, we introduce ML from clinical practitioner's perspective and discuss what ML does right, where it falls short, and how it will impact patient care. 

Ethical Algorithms for the Modern Clinician is intended as foundational knowledge for medical students of all backgrounds - prior experience with machine learning is not required. The course focuses on several key aspects:

1. [**Introduction to Machine Learning**](/ml.html): What is machine learning? How is it similar to and different from conventional software?
2. [**Bias and Fairness**](/bias.html): How can algorithms be biased against different patient groups? How can we quantify, detect, and reduce bias in clinical decision making algorithms?
3. [**Privacy and Anonymization**](/privacy.html): How can we anonymize patient data? Why does anonymization often fall short in protecting patient identities? How can we ensure that clinicians maintain patient privacy?
4. [**Algorithmic Interpretability**](/interpretability.html): What does mean for an algorithm to be interpretable? Is it important for us to be able to explain how an algorithm works in order to use it in clinical practice?
5. [**Generative AI**](/genai.html): What is generative AI, and how might it be used for patient care? What are the new challenges and opportunities associated with generative AI models?
6. **Clinical Applications of AI**: How is AI used in the clinical world today, and how can we apply AI in our future work? How is AI usage similar and/or different among specialties? What is the interplay between policy and AI, and how does it shape our practice as clinicians?

Just as epidemiology was introduced in medical school curricula alongside the rise of evidence-based guidelines[^1], **it is crucial for future clinicians to have a working understanding of machine learning algorithms** as they become increasingly prevalent in clinical practice. Much of the curriculum has been inspired by the (much longer) ethical algorithms course at Penn taught by [Michael Kearns](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/). *Ethical Algorithms for the Modern Clinician* is intended as foundational knowledge for medical students **of all backgrounds** - prior experience with machine learning is *not* required.

## Course Attendance

This course consists of eight sessions, each lasting one hour. Students are expected to attend **all sessions** to receive [HMET area of concentration (AOC)](https://www.med.upenn.edu/student/areas-of-concentration.html#accordion-7) credit. The course is intended to be an active, discussion-based class, and students are expected to engage in discussion with their peers.

## Assessment and Grading

The main assessment of the course is the **final capstone project**, consisting of a one-page essay on a prompt focusing on ethical AI implementation in healthcare. As part of this project, students will also be encouraged to utilize generative AI to aid in idea refinement, and the generative AI model and specific prompts used to do so will be submitted alongside the essay. The goal of this essay and usage of generative AI is to 1) apply the concepts learned in class; and 2) teach students how to effectively use and write prompts for generative AI.

Ethical Algorithms for Modern Clinician is graded as **Pass-Fail** based on attendance and the final capstone project.

Surveys will also be administered at the beginning and end of the course, as well as after each session, to gauge efficacy and solicit constructive feedback.

## How to Use This Book

Everyone learns differently. Some find it most helpful to self-study the material, which usually can be done in a weekend according to prior students. We believe the most effective and fruitful way to learn the content herein is in **small, discussion-based** classroom environments. Many of the discussion questions included in each module have *no single right answer*, and it is often helpful to learn how peers are thinking about challenging topics, too. To facilitate this learning environment, the content has been broken down into five modules that can each be covered in one-hour sessions.

### What This Resource Is *Not*

There are a lot of machine learning resources out there already - what makes *Ethical Algorithms for the Modern Clinician* different? This resource is ***not*** any of the following:

1. **A introduction to theory of and programming for machine learning**: If you're interested in building ML models from scratch, the MedML@Emory Club has put together a fantastic tutorial [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eij5s6YoSthXUAWMUJ0-ouydIFK0D_1d?usp=sharing), and [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/) also has a great curated list of technical tutorials [here](https://www.coursera.org/collections/machine-learning).
2. **An overview of the computational techniques used to build machine learning models**: If you're looking for something like this, we recommend checking out recent work by [Pfob et al. (2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36319956/) and [Sidey-Gibbons et al. (2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30890124/).
3. **A mathematically rigorous foundation for assessing algorithmic fairness and privacy**: If this is something you're interested in, we highly recommend checking out [The Ethical Algorithm](https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Algorithm-Science-Socially-Design/dp/0190948205) and the [Ethical Algorithm Design](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/teaching/EADSpring24/) course offered at Penn every year.

## Adoption and Feedback

*Ethical Algorithms for the Modern Clinician* has been adapted as annual student-run elective courses at both the **University of Pennsylvania** and **Mt. Sinai** schools of medicine. Portions of the course have also been integrated into **[graduate seminar courses](https://www.med.upenn.edu/kbjohnsonlab/hhct/)** and the **Epidemiology** course for first-year medical students at Penn.

The course has been presented at the **[2025 AAMC Annual Meeting](https://www.aamc.org/learn-network/learn-serve-lead)** and **[2025 NeurIPS Educational Program](https://openreview.net/forum?id=FIQeorc5z5)**.
