## Overview

*Ethical Algorithms for the Modern Clinician* is a short course intended to teach future clinicians the basics of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) as they pertain to clinical practice.

This resource does ***not*** discuss how machine learning algorithms work or how to build ML models. Instead, we introduce ML from clinical practitioner's perspective and discuss what ML does right, where it falls short, and how it will impact patient care. We focus on five key aspects:

1. [**Introduction to Machine Learning**](/ml.html): What is machine learning? How is it similar to and different from conventional software?
2. [**Bias and Fairness**](/bias.html): How can algorithms be biased against different patient groups? How can we quantify, detect, and reduce bias in clinical decision making algorithms?
3. [**Privacy and Anonymization**](/privacy.html): How can we anonymize patient data? Why does anonymization often fall short in protecting patient identities? How can we ensure that clinicians maintain patient privacy?
4. [**Algorithmic Interpretability**](/interpretability.html): What does mean for an algorithm to be interpretable? Is it important for us to be able to explain how an algorithm works in order to use it in clinical practice?
5. [**Generative AI**](/genai.html): What is generative AI, and how might it be used for patient care? What are the new challenges and opportunities associated with generative AI models?

Just as epidemiology was introduced in medical school curricula alongside the rise of evidence-based guidelines[^1], **it is crucial for future clinicians to have a working understanding of machine learning algorithms** as they become increasingly prevalent in clinical practice. Much of the curriculum has been inspired by the (much longer) ethical algorithms course at Penn taught by [Michael Kearns](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/). *Ethical Algorithms for the Modern Clinician* is intended as foundational knowledge for medical students **of all backgrounds** - prior experience with machine learning is *not* required.

## How to Use This Book

Everyone learns differently. Some find it most helpful to self-study the material, which usually can be done in a weekend according to prior students. We believe the most effective and fruitful way to learn the content herein is in **small, discussion-based** classroom environments. Many of the discussion questions included in each module have *no single right answer*, and it is often helpful to learn how peers are thinking about challenging topics, too. To facilitate this learning environment, the content has been broken down into five modules that can each be covered in one-hour sessions.

### What This Resource Is *Not*

There are a lot of machine learning resources out there already - what makes *Ethical Algorithms for the Modern Clinician* different? This resource is ***not*** any of the following:

1. **A introduction to theory of and programming for machine learning**: If you're interested in building ML models from scratch, the MedML@Emory Club has put together a fantastic tutorial [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eij5s6YoSthXUAWMUJ0-ouydIFK0D_1d?usp=sharing), and [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/) also has a great curated list of technical tutorials [here](https://www.coursera.org/collections/machine-learning).
2. **An overview of the computational techniques used to build machine learning models**: If you're looking for something like this, we recommend checking out recent work by [Pfob et al. (2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36319956/) and [Sidey-Gibbons et al. (2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30890124/).
3. **A mathematically rigorous foundation for assessing algorithmic fairness and privacy**: If this is something you're interested in, we highly recommend checking out [The Ethical Algorithm](https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Algorithm-Science-Socially-Design/dp/0190948205) and the [Ethical Algorithm Design](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/teaching/EADSpring24/) course offered at Penn every year.
